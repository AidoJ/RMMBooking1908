2. Existing therapists will use radius fallback automatically
3. Admin can add polygons gradually - no rush
4. Booking platform handles both polygon and radius seamlessly
5. No breaking changes - fully backwards compatible

### Database Migration
```sql
-- Already applied
ALTER TABLE therapist_profiles ADD COLUMN service_area_polygon JSONB;
CREATE INDEX idx_therapist_service_area_polygon ON therapist_profiles USING GIN (service_area_polygon);
```
